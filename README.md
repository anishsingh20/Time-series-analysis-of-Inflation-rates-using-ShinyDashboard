# Analzying-Inflation-Rates-Worldwide
This project will aim at studying and analyzing the inflation rates of countries globally. The dataset is a public dataset downloaded from International Monetary Fund(IMF) which consists of the inflation rates of countries from 1980 to 2017 and the projected inflation rates of the countries till 2022.

After analyzing I will be making a Shiny Dashboard in R to visualize the inflation rates of countries, economic unions as well as world.

### What is Inflation rate?

Inflation rates are the general rate at which price of the goods and services within a particular economy are rising and the __purchasing power__ of the currency is declining due to the highly priced goods. High inflation is definately not good for an economy because it will always reduce the value for money. In genral central banks of an ecomony tries to and work towards reducing the inflation rate and avoiding __deflation__. 

__Deflation__ is opposite of inflation. Delfation occurs when the inflation rates become negetive or are below 0. Deflation is more harmful and dangerous for an economy because it means that the prices of goods and services are going to decrease. Now this sounds amazing for consumers like us. But what actually happens is that the demand of goods and services have declined over a long term of time. This directly indicates that a __recession__ is on its way. This brings job losses , declining wages and a big hit to the stock portfolio. Deflation slows economy's growth. As prices fall , people defer(postpone) purchases in hope of a better lower price deal. Due to this companies and firms have to cut down the cost of their goods and products which directly affects the wages of the employees which have to be lowered.
